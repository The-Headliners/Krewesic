      'strBiographyEN': 'V were a British five-piece boyband made up of Antony Thomas Brant, Aaron Buckingham, Mark Harle, Kevin McDaid and Leon Pisani.\nBand member Antony Brant came up with the band name "V" because V is the Roman numeral for five and there were five members in the band. V made their debut at the same time as McFly by supporting Busted\'s arena tour in the spring of 2004.\nTheir first single, "Blood, Sweat and Tears", was released in May 2004 and went into the UK Singles Chart at number 6. The video was shot in Miami, Florida in February 2004 and the single contained a collaboration with McFly, called "Chills in the Evening" written by Tom Fletcher from McFly and James Bourne from Busted. The band\'s second single, released in the August 2004, was a double A-side consisted of a new song "Hip To Hip" and a cover of The Jacksons\'s song "Can You Feel It" (with a video of the band dressed as a double glazing salesman, ice cream man, postman, milkman and paperboy) and charted at number 5 in the UK Singles Chart.\nThe third single, "You Stood Up" reached number 12 after an appearance on Top of The Pops, but their debut album of the same name only made number 86 on the UK Albums Chart. In February 2005, V announced on their website their decision to split up.',

      'strBiographyEN': 'P was a short-lived American alternative rock band formed in early 1993 by Butthole Surfers frontman Gibby Haynes (vocals), actor Johnny Depp (guitar/bass), actor Sal Jenco (percussion), and songwriter Bill Carter (guitar/bass). The band performed their first show at the Austin Music Awards in 1993 and released their eponymous album on November 21, 1995 under Capitol Records. It was reissued on May 8, 2007 under Caroline Records. They often played the odd gig at The Viper Room, of which Depp used to be co-owner. One of these gigs was played on October 30, 1993, where the lineup included Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers. Haynes, along with other members of the line-up that night, was a good friend of actor River Phoenix. While the band were in the middle of their song "Michael Stipe", which includes the lines "I\'m glad I met old Michael Stipe, I didn\'t get to see his car. Him and River Phoenix were leaving on the road tomorrow" and "but we didn\'t have a part, not a piece of our heart, not Michael, River Phoenix or Flea or me." Phoenix (unbeknownst to the band at the time) was outside the venue having seizures on the sidewalk. Phoenix died in the early hours of October 31 of heart failure brought on by an overdose of cocaine and heroin.',

      'strBiographyEN': '"t",  born and based in Germany, multi-instrumentalist Thomas Thielen has been recording music as a one-man act since his time with the short-lived progressive rock act Scythe ended. Initially a keyboard player, he started taking piano lessons in 1980. One year prior to finishing those he joined a band in 1992. Although that experience apparently was rather uneventful, it lead to Thielen changing his choice of main instrument; and during his tenure with this group he decided to start learning the guitar.\nSoon after he joined a blues band as bassist; but that did not last too long either. It was a useful experience nonetheless; as the lack of rehearsing, planning and innovation led Thielen to want to do the exact opposite in his music. Around this time he started checking out a band called Marillion; which subsequently made him discover early 70\'s Genesis. While looking up this «mythic» music he also started taking singing lessons; from what one can read on his homepage, this was the start of a long and still ongoing journey of discovery and evolvement.',
