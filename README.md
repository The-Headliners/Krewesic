This app was developed using node v14.17.5 and postgres 12.7
1. Clone down repo , change into the root directory for the project, and run npm install
2. Make sure postgres is installed on your computer.  Open postgres shell and create a database 'krewesic',  (CREATE DATABASE krewesic)
3. To use the database use \dt krewesic (on windows: \c krewesic)
4. Set up db.config -- see db.config below
5. Run npm run dev or npm run build to compile the webpack, depending if you are working in production or development mode
6. Set up environmental variables.  see the env section below for format
7. The Google_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET are the keys from OAuth 2 (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard
).  SEATGEEK_CLIENT_ID and SEATGEEK_SECRET come from the seatgeek platform. (https://seatgeek.com/account/develop)
8. For the google maps api key, see instructions below in google maps api key
9. after all this set up, run npm start from the root directory and the app should be running from the designated PORT.
## env
  root directory, create .env  file
   here put google clientID and clientSecret that you get for oauth2
 also you need session secret

  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=yourgoogleclientid
  SESSION_SECRET='whateversecretwordyouwantforsessions'
  SEATGEEK_CLIENT_ID='your seat geek client id here'
  SEATGEEK_SECRET='your seatgeek secret here"
## db config

in db folder create a file called db.config.js.  you want your db configuration here:
module.exports = {
  HOST: "localhost",
  USER: {your postgres username here},
  PASSWORD: {your password here},
  DB: "krewesic",

## peerjs
for the video streaming, peerjs uses a server for p2p connections.  To start the server, globally install peer: 
npm i -g peer   then open a terminal and run:  peerjs --port 3002

## frontend
In the frontend we used react routing in order to navigate between the components we utilized.
The login component is the first component you encounter. After we have the form component in which
the user is redirected to upon their first login on the site. The form component is there for the purpose of choosing
which type of profile you would like to create. The two choices are listener and artist. If you click listener you are redirected to
the listenerForm component where you will fill out listener user information necessary to setting up your user profile. If you click artist you are redirected to
the artistForm component where you will fill out artist user information necessary to setting up your user profile.

Upon clicking the create profile button you are redirected to the home page dubbed the artist of the day in which the application on a 24 hour basis display a random artist in order to boost their status. This component displays relevant information to the artist as well as allows users to check out their artist profile by clicking their information on the artist of the day component.

We have a Navbar displayed on every page that indicate where you can navigate in the application. We have profile which display information you filled out during your profile creation. This component will conditionally render the profile based on the user type. We also have an events component that allows you to interact with google maps on our application and search for concerts in a designated timeframe you fill out.

Listeners on the app also have the ability to directly live chat with one another via websocket integration. This allows users to further interact and plan for potential concerts with other users on the app.

## styling
For styling, we implemented material-ui into our application in order to design our components.
